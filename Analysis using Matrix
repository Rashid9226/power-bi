Matrix and Tables performs a good hand in visualizing the relation between the features. Both are in two diamentional in which values are organized in rows
and columns, They are similar to eachother but Hirarchy is introduced in Matrix.
Hirarchy in matrix is making features into certain levels:
  eg: if A and B are two features in a data By the help of matrix we can bring B in A.
Both rows and columns can use Hirarchy, hence matrix can give you mare analysis than Table
